\subsection*{Tikz Interaction}
\textit{Use }\texttt{disabledatascaling}\textit{ opt\textquotesingle n to coerce tikz to pgfplots coord system. Then Tikz accordingly, eg:}

\code{\textbackslash draw[thick,<->] (\$(\textbackslash x,\{sin(2 * \textbackslash x)\})\$) -{}- \dots} %(\$(\{\x+2*3.14},{sin(2 * \x - 3.14/4)})$)} 
\\
