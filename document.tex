\subsection*{Scaling}


\textit{To size and scale a plot, use either }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/width}{\opt{width}}\textit{ and }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/height}{\opt{height}}\textit{, or position along unit vectors as indicated with }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/x}{\opt{x}}\textit{, }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/y}{\opt{y}}\textit{, and }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/z}{\opt{z}}\textit{. Related general scaling, sizing, \& aspect-ratio options include:}\\
{\color{blue}
\begin{minipage}[t]{1.2cm}
width\\
height\\
x\\
y\\
z
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{2.2cm}
[x|y|z] dir\\
scale only axis\\
scale mode\\
z mode\\
axis equal
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{3.3cm}
axis equal image\\
unit vector ratio\\
unit vector ratio*\\
{[x|y|z]} post scale
\end{minipage}}


\textit{Some pre-fab scaling styles for controlling various axis \& font settings: }\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:mode}{\opt{normalsize}}, \href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:mode}{\opt{small}}, \href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:mode}{\opt{footnotesize}}, and \href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:mode}{\opt{tiny}}.\\

\textit{Additionally, low-level control is afforded through several scaling \say{strategies}.}

\begin{comment}
\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:mode}{\opt{scale mode}} = auto | none | stretch to fill | scale uniformly \\
\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/scale:uniformly:strategy}{\opt{scale uniformly strategy}} = auto | units only | change vertical limits | change horizontal lines\\
\href{\docurl\#pgfp./pgfplots/unit:rescale:keep:size}{\opt{unit rescale keep size}} = true | false | unless limits declared | limits declared\\
